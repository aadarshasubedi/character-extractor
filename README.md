# character-extractor
This is a simple Windows Desktop app I'm writing in Visual Basic using Visual Studio Community 2015.

The function of the app is to extract characters from a string and display them, e.g. for when a website wants you to paste in the 5th, 12th and 24th character from a password.

I'm sure there are easier ways of doing that (e.g. a spreadsheet or Javascript web page) but I wanted the experience of writing my own solution. I write quite a few VBA apps for my work, but am not very proficient or experience in VB. So having a go at it!
